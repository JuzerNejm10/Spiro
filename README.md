# Spiro
animations/processing


procedural style
interesting random animations featuring spiral shapes mostly
use scroll wheel to zoom in/out
click once to make shapes follow mouse cursor
click again to disable cursor following
press "R" to record current animation (it will most probably slow down but the recording will be ok - hopefully)
text file will be saved along with the video, it contains values of various parametars of the current animation (for now it's mostly for my own use but you can analyze it if you wish)
the files (.mp4 and .txt) are stored in (sketch) folder called Spiro
if you press "R" once more the animation will run smoothly again but the video will be empty (.txt file will be alright though)
you can press it for the 3rd time if you really wish to record it
video file is finalized when the sketch is stopped (stop button in Processing editor, ESC or ALT+F4)

this app makes use of Video Export library (https://github.com/hamoid/video_export_processing)
1st time the app is played it will ask you to locate FFmpeg.exe file on your computer
if you don't have it you can download it from here https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

have fun
